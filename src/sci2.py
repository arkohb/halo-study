  ["After fertilisation the parts of the flower develop into the parts of the fruit and seed.",

  ["The structure of a flower matches its agent of pollination, whether that is wind or insect.",
   "Wind-pollinated flowers do not need to attract insects; they produce large amounts of light pollen and have exposed, feathery stigmas."])
O("In humans, fertilisation normally takes place in the ___", ["fallopian tube", "uterus", "ovary", "vagina"],
  ["Fertilisation is the fusion of a sperm with an egg, and it happens where the two meet.",
   "The sperm meets the egg in the fallopian tube (oviduct); the fertilised egg then moves to the uterus to implant."])
O("The structure through which the developing foetus obtains food and oxygen from the mother is the ___",
  ["placenta", "amnion", "umbilical vein only", "uterus wall"],
  ["The developing foetus depends on the mother for food and oxygen and for removal of its waste.",
   "The placenta allows exchange of nutrients, oxygen and waste between the mother's blood and the foetal blood, which do not mix."])

   "(b) 1. Wind: small, dull petals or none; Insect: large, brightly coloured petals. 2. Wind: no scent or nectar; Insect: scented, with nectar. "
   "3. Wind: pollen light, smooth and in large amounts; Insect: pollen sticky or spiky and in smaller amounts. "
   "4. Wind: anthers and feathery stigmas hang outside the flower; Insect: anthers and sticky stigmas are inside.",
   "(c) A pollen grain lands on the stigma and germinates, growing a pollen tube down the style to the ovary. "
   "The male gamete passes down the tube and fuses with the egg cell in the ovule — fertilisation. "
   "The fertilised ovule develops into a seed, containing an embryo and stored food, while the ovary wall develops into the fruit. "
   "The petals, stamens and style usually wither and fall off.",
   "(d) It allows food and oxygen to pass from the mother's blood to the foetus; it allows carbon dioxide and urea to pass from the foetus "
   "to the mother; it acts as a barrier against some harmful substances and germs; and it produces hormones that maintain the pregnancy."], marks=15)
